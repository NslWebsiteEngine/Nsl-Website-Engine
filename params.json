{"name":"Nsl-website-engine","tagline":"The ultimative newsocialife.com website engine. Look the examples to see how it's simple to use it.","body":"# NSL Website Engine\r\n\r\nThis engine was originally developed for the new version of New Social Life, which is still in development :). This engine is really powerful, something that you have to try.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nA simple usage of the library would be something like this: \r\n```php\r\nfunction test(string $a, number $b, mixed $c) {\r\n\tif(is_array($c))\r\n\t\treturn [\"a\"];\r\n\telse\r\n\t\treturn ++$number;\r\n}\r\nfunction test2(number $a, boolean $b) {\r\n\tif($a == 5)\r\n\t\treturn $b;\r\n\treturn false; \r\n}\r\ntest(\"Hello\", 12, []); // returns an array with an element a\r\ntest(\"Hello\", 12.1, false); // return 13.1\r\ntest(\"Hello\", 12.0, false); // return 13.0\r\ntest(12, \"Hello\", false); // THIS ONE THROWS A PHP ERROR\r\ntest2(2, true); // returns false\r\ntest2(5, true); // return true\r\ntest2(5, false); // returns false\r\ntest2(\"hello\", false); // THIS ONE THROWS A PHP ERROR\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course this is just one of the thousand features you can use with my library.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\nDeveloper: Danny Morabito\r\nYou can use this in your projects but the developers' names HAVE to be in the comment of every file.\r\nThis library uses some things like twig and klein.php, i didn't develop them, so the credits are to their, not mine.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
